Telehealth Statement: I advised the patient that this visit will be performed using a HIPAA compliant telehealth tool, including a live video connection between the patient's location and my location. I answered all the patient's questions, and the patient gave his/her consent for telehealth visit. Subsequently, I performed consultation using telehealth and live video conference. I performed a virtual musculoskeletal or neurological examination based on specific set of guidelines to enhance the information obtained when evaluating the musculoskeletal and neurological systems. Most of these tests are based on validated physical exam maneuvers under my observation.
