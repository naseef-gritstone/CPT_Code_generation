I answered all the patient's questions, and the patient gave his/her consent for telehealth visit. Subsequently, I performed consultation using telehealth and live video conference. I performed a virtual musculoskeletal or neurological examination based on specific set of guidelines to enhance the information obtained when evaluating the musculoskeletal and neurological systems. Most of these tests are based on validated physical exam maneuvers under my observation.
